Basic AngularJS project created to learn subject matter. The directory of ninjas is loaded via a JSON file and can be ordered through the use of AngularJS' order function. Includes sample animations upon addition and removal of ninjas or when navigating between views. This project helped me better understand the basics of AngularJS and its utilization of two-way data binding as well as serving as an introduction to MVC design patterns in JavaScript.
